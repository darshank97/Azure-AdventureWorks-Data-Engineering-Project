# ðŸš€ Azure Adventure Works Data Engineering Project  

This project demonstrates a **complete Data Engineering pipeline on Azure** â€” starting from ingestion of raw data, applying transformations in **Databricks**, building a serving layer in **Synapse**, and finally ingesting data to **Power BI reports** for business insights.  

It follows the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold)** to ensure scalability, data quality, and efficient reporting.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Architecture  

The end-to-end flow is as follows:  

1. **Data Source**  
   - Dataset sourced from **Kaggle** (present in the `dataset/` folder).  
   - Automated ingestion pipeline pulls data from **GitHub repo** into Azure.  

2. **Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)**  
   - Azure **Data Factory** pipelines automate ingestion.  
   - Data stored in **Raw Data Lake (Data Lake Gen2)**.  

3. **Transformation (Silver Layer)**  
   - Data is processed in **Azure Databricks**:  
     - Standardizing **date formats**  
     - Splitting string values into structured fields  
   - Clean/curated data stored in the **Transformed Zone (Data Lake Gen2)**.  

4. **Serving (Gold Layer)**  
   - External data sources and tables created in **Azure Synapse Analytics**.  
   - Optimized gold layer for analytics and BI consumption.  

5. **Reporting**  
   - **Power BI** dashboards connected to Synapse for visualization using SQL Endpoints.

## âš¡ Pipeline Workflow

- **Upload Kaggle dataset** to dataset/ or configure GitHub repo as ingestion source.
- **Trigger Data Factory pipelines** to move data â†’ Raw Data Lake (Bronze).
- **Run Databricks notebooks** for data transformations â†’ Transformed Data Lake (Silver).
- **Execute Synapse SQL** scripts to create external data sources & tables â†’ Gold Layer.
- **Connect Power BI** to Synapse and design dashboards.
